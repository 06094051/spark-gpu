{"name":"Spark-gpu","tagline":"Spark GPU and SIMD Support","body":"# Welcome to the spark-gpu wiki!\r\n\r\nThis is a prototype of [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) to effectively store partition data in a column-based RDD in an array format. The motivation is to accelerate Spark workloads by using GPU and SIMD in Apache Spark \r\nOriginal Apache Spark keeps data as Scala sequence for each row on Java heap. This prototype keeps data as a contiguous array for each column on off-heap.\r\n\r\nYou can see our current performance improvement (**more than 3x**) at [benchmark section](http://github.com/kiszk/spark-gpu/wiki/Benchmark).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nYou can run our prototype in your box with NVIDIA GPU card or run AWS EC2 by following the procedure described [here](https://github.com/kiszk/spark-gpu/wiki/How-to-run-(local-or-AWS-EC2))\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can download pre-build binary from (http://github.com/kiszk/spark-gpu/wiki/Downloads). \r\n\r\n\r\n##### Please also visit other pages from the menu in the right-hand side.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nCurrent version has several limitations\r\n* support only x86_64 and ppc64le\r\n * support OpenJDK and IBM JDK\r\n* Support only NVIDIA GPU with CUDA (we confirmed with CUDA 7.0)\r\n * support CUDA 7.0 and 7.5 (should work with CUDA 6.0 and 6.5)\r\n* support scalar variables in primitive scalar types and an primitive array in RDD\r\n* support a new column format for map and reduce functions\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture plan\r\n* Generate GPU and SIMD code from a Spark application program\r\n * Now, a programmer has to provide CUDA function for GPU kernels in Spark functions\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
